## Update packages

```
 sudo apt-get update
```

## Install nginx

```
sudo apt-get install nginx
```

## Check version

```
 nginx -v
```

## How to add personal domain

```
Go to the domain website and add the dns as AWS instace Ip address
```

## Run nginx

```
 sudo nginx
```

```
 sudo nginx -s reload
```

## After this nginx running on ip address

## Config Nginx to run the website on domain and works without writing :portNumber

``` 
Path : /etc/nginx/sites-available/default

server_name aman-meenia.work.gd, www.aman-meenia.work.gd;

 location / {
               server_name aman-meenia.work.gd, www.aman-meenia.work.gd; # First attempt to serve request as file, then
                # as directory, then fall back to displaying a 404.
                 proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;
                proxy_http_version 1.1;
                proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
                proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
                proxy_set_header Host $host;
                proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;

        }
```

## To test config is correct or not

```
sudo nginx -t
```

## Reload

```
sudo nginx -s reload
```


## SSL certificate using certbot

```
 sudo apt install certbot python3-certbot-nginx
```

## For what domain you want ssh certificate 

```
 sudo certbot --nginx -d next-auth.work.gd -d www.next-aut.work.gd
```

## Renew certificate automatically

```
sudo certbot renew --dry-run
```


# Anotherw way for free ssl

```
sudo snap install core; sudo snap refresh core
```

```
sudo apt remove certbot
```

```
sudo snap install --classic certbot
```

```
sudo ln -s /snap/bin/certbot /usr/bin/certbot
```


```
sudo certbot --nginx -d app.example.com 
```


### Verify Certbot Auto-Renewal

```
sudo systemctl status snap.certbot.renew.service
```

### To test the renewal process, you can do a dry run with certbot:

```
sudo certbot renew --dry-run
```


### Proxy_http_version 1.1;

```
This specifies the HTTP version that Nginx should use when communicating with the upstream server (your app). HTTP/1.1 supports features like persistent connections and chunked transfer encoding, which are often required for modern web apps.
```

### proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;

```
This line ensures that the `Upgrade` header from the client is passed along to the upstream server. This is crucial for handling WebSocket connections, which rely on the `Upgrade` header to switch from HTTP to the WebSocket protocol.
```

### proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';

```
Similar to the `Upgrade` header, this sets the `Connection` header to `'upgrade'`. This header is also essential for WebSocket communication, ensuring that the connection can be upgraded from HTTP to WebSocket.
```

### proxy_set_header Host $host;

```
This directive passes the original `Host` header from the client to the upstream server. The `$host` variable dynamically captures the domain name or IP address that the client used to access the server, ensuring that the upstream server receives the correct `Host` header.
```
### proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;

```
This setting tells Nginx to bypass its caching mechanisms if the `Upgrade` header is present in the request. This is necessary for WebSocket connections to function correctly, as caching can interfere with the real-time communication required by WebSockets.
```
